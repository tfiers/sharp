Note: the plots created in these modules do not plot data outside of the
x-limits. This confines interactive exploration (e.g. in Jupyter Notebooks with
`%matplotlib notebook`) to the immediately plotted data. It greatly speeds up
figure creation however, which is useful for the long-duration signals that we
deal with in this thesis.
